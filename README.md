## General info

Mobile apps are everywhere. They are easy to create and can be lucrative. Because of these two factors, more and more apps are being developed.

With more than 1 billion active users in 190 countries around the world, Google Play continues to be an important distribution platform to build a global audience. For businesses to get their apps in front of users, it's important to make them more quickly and easily discoverable on Google Play. To improve the overall search experience, Google has introduced the concept of grouping apps into categories.

This brings us to the following questions:

Which category has the highest share of (active) apps in the market?
Is any specific category dominating the market?
Which categories have the fewest number of apps?
